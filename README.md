# Petrol Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python project for predicting petrol prices in Delhi using Linear Regression. The model uses historical data with dates and corresponding petrol prices to forecast future prices. 

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of Linear Regression for time series data prediction. We utilize a dataset containing petrol prices recorded on various dates to build a model that predicts future petrol prices.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is `petrol.csv`, which contains the following columns:
  - **Date**: Date of the petrol price record.
  - **Delhi**: Petrol price in Delhi on the given date.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
